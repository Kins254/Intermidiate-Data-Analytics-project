# Intermediate-Data-Analytics-project
The Project was for my intermediate level project

#The following was the objective of the project.
A study was carried out to explore the relationship between distance per jogging session and several potential predicting factors in 666 participants. Activity-related variables measured were Heath_Awareness (high score = low awareness), Computer_Games (high score = more time spent playing computer games), Television (high score = more time spent watching television), Diet (high score = the child has a good diet low in additives), and Peer_influence (high score = more influence to exercise from peers). Past research indicated that health awareness and peer influence were good predictors of the tendency to exercise. All other variables were treated in an exploratory fashion. The data are in the file Exercise_study.csv. Analyze them the appropriate model choice.
We need to conduct this analysis hierarchically, entering health awareness and peer influence in the first step (forced entry) and the remaining variables in a second step. Compare the model with health awareness plus peer influence and that with the remaining variables (anova(model1, model2)). Interpret and assess the reliability of the chosen model. 

I have attached the RMarkdown and the Report document for data presentation.
